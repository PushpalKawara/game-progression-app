## 📌 Overview

This is a **Game Analytics tool** that provides insights into player behavior across game levels – particularly focusing on **drop-off points** and **retention trends**.

The tool processes raw Excel data exported from a game's backend and delivers visualized insights to help:

- Identify high-drop levels 🛑
- Measure level-wise retention 🔁
- Track user engagement across stages 📊

> Built with ❤️ using Python & Streamlit, this tool showcases my hands-on ability to extract, process, analyze, and visualize game data efficiently.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

During my role as a **Game Analyst Intern**, I worked with datasets that contained:
- Player progress (Levels)
- User attempts, fails, and completion time
- Engagement patterns

To automate manual calculations and improve insights, I designed this tool. It made analysis faster, clearer, and more actionable.

🧩 **This is not a company-made product, but a personal project inspired by real-world problems.**
